	<b>How to explore this map:</b>This map has multiple layers that you can turn on and off using the legend (upper right). It represents the homes, date palms and the animals that are documented in John Gordon Lorimer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer_of_the_Persian_Gulf,_Oman_and_Central_Arabia" class="link"> Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia</a> for the historical neighborhoods of Buraimi.  Click on the picture icon and you will see a breakdown of the data for each of the neighborhoods in the pop-up box.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Context:</b> This map's dataset is based on data extracted from the two entries of the Geographical and Statistical section of Lorimer's Gazetteer. The entries are "Baraimi Oasis" and "Baraimi Village." Buraimi is a historical oasis sitting on the border between Oman and the UAE.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Geolocation:</b> The text of the entries were annotated in <a href="https://recogito.pelagios.org/" class="link">Recogito</a>. The geographical coordinates are provided by <a href="https://geonames.org" class="link">GeoNames</a> (with the GeoNames ID found in the dataset). You will notice that the coordinates assigned to each of the historical neighborhoods actually correspond to present day neighborhoods close to the parts of the oases. We chose to use the GeoNames location over the contemporary date groves.
</p>
<p> 
	<b>Notes on data decisions:</b> One location JƒÅhali did not specify numbers of animals and only listed homes as "few".  Column M of the <a href="https://github.com/opengulf/Lorimer_data/blob/master/palms_livestock_Buraimi.csv" class="link" >dataset</a> is of our own fabrication, representing the sum total of numbers of animals. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>Further mapping:</b> We see some ways that could extend this map to account for 
	<ol>
		<li> distinctions between the peoples living in these neighborhoods</li>
		<li> the quantities of date palms, human dwellings and animals for the entire Gazetteer</li>
	</ol>
</p>
