How to explore this map: [insert here] 

Context: This map is based on data extracted from the two entries of the Geographical and Statistical section of [John Gordon Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer_of_the_Persian_Gulf,_Oman_and_Central_Arabia). The entries are "Baraimi Oasis" and "Baraimi Village." It represents the locations and quantities of date palms, houses and a number of animals in Buraimi, a historical oasis sitting on the border between Oman and the UAE around the year 1907. The attributes were chosen by the team on the basis of using Lorimer's entries to produce meaningful, visually appealing and contextual maps. 

Geolocation: The text of the entries were annotated in [Recogito]( https://recogito.pelagios.org/). The geographical coordinates are provided by [GeoNames](geonames.org) (with the GeoNames ID found in the dataset). You will notice that the coordinates assigned to each of the historical neighborhoods actually correspond to present day neighborhoods close to the parts of the oases. We chose to use the GeoNames location over the contemporary date groves. 

Notes on data decisions: One location JƒÅhali did not specify numbers of animals and only listed homes as "few".  Column M of the dataset is of our own fabrication, representing the sum total of numbers of animals. 

Further mapping: It would be interesting to follow up on different kinds of distinctions between the peoples living in these neighborhoods. It would be interesting to build such a map of date palms and numbers of animals for the entire Gazetteer.
