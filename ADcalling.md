<h2 id="content">About the Abu Dhabi Calling! Project</h2>
<p>The “Abu Dhabi Calling!” project uses city directories as research tools for urban history in order to understand locational patterns of demographics, ethnic and religious identity as well as urban development in the capital city of the United Arab Emirates across the last three decades of the twentieth century. The Abu Dhabi Calling! Project is the recipient of a 2020 NYU Digital Humanities Seed Grant.</p>
