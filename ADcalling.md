<p>The “Abu Dhabi Calling!” project uses city phone directories from the capital city of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, over the period 1970-2000 as research tools for urban history.  The project aims to create a "social map" of the city's past, in order to understand patterns of demographics, ethnic and religious identity, residential location as well as urban development. It aims to expand the project of historical collaborative geocoding beyond the Western urban contexts in which it is usually found bringing it to the study of the Arab region. The Abu Dhabi Calling! Project is the recipient of a NYU Digital Humanities Seed Grant in 2020.</p>
