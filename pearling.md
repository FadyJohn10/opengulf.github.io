<p>
	This is a simple map that shows the location of pearling towns and their corresponding flag of the protecting entity. The legend gives an indication of the color of the point on the map that corresponds to each country and the information for each location could be seen when clicking on each point. However, it is important to note that some of the locations listed in Lorimer's table could not be located.
