<p>
	This map shows some of the Baraimi locations and their corresponding attributes. This data comes from the Lorimer gazetteer, Lorimer Geographical. We extracted the LAT/LNG values for the places mentioned and produced a dataset which contains the LAT/LNG values along with the quantities of the relevant attributes. The attributes were chosen by the team on the basis of using Lorimer's entries to produce meaningful, visually appealing and contextual maps.
