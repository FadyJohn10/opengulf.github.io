<h2 id="content">Designing the OpenGulf website: process, progress and decision making </h2> 
	<b>Liyan Ibrahim</b>

<p> 
	Designing the website for a project at the same time you are developing the project can be challenging.  It is important to make the most suitable design decisions for both the content and the concept of the project. Our website is static one, coded using HTML and using Github pages and Jekyll themes. While the theme used <a href="https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme" class="link">"Forty"</a> is readily available, there was a certain level of customization of its "out of the box" functionality  to meet the purposes of the project.
</p>
<p>
	OpenGulf is a set of interconnected digital projects that aim to create, visualize and disseminate historical data about the Gulf region. The representation of OpenGulf as a concept, along with the project data itself, drove our decisions about the format of the menu as well as the format of each subcategory in the site. OpenGulf is an initiative  with different moving parts, and it was desirable for us that visitors to the project website are able to take away concise portrayals of the different projects, but also to navigate between different project outcomes and to have access to their data. Therefore, one of the first steps included identifying all of these moving parts and subcategories and further grouping them into subsets. For example,  Abu Dhabi Calling!, Handwritten Gulf Archives, Historical Texts as Data, Coming Soon and Digital Exhibits are all sub-entities of the larger category Projects, found on the landing page of OpenGulf.  
	Additionally, since our project involves a team that is continuously evolving, producing and adding content, in the initial phases of design the Projects page format kept changing as well. The theme provides a choice of multiple layouts that we wanted to be accessible and easy to navigate but also reflect the different kinds of content of each page. An example of this is seen in the contrast between Projects and Blogs. While they both allow us to navigate to different subpages, Blogs is formatted such that the subpages are in the form of links while Projects is formatted with blocks like the homepage. This difference, although subtle, is significant  since the content they carry varies and  features different aspects of the project. Furthermore, Github static websites allowed us to completely run and edit the website locally before syncing it and making it live. This functionally was helpful since we got to view the exact look of the website without rolling it out live However, since multiple people were working on the project and would hence want to add content to different parts of the website, we needed a way to facilitate such collaboration whilst still keeping the website local. This is where we decided to make a detailed report on each of the different categories, subcategories and their content in a wiki format for the team to add, remove and move things. Regular check-ins about the structure and design of the site took place running locally from my device as the content was created.
</p>
<p>
	In summary, due to the nature of this project, using a static website made the most sense, since they are more sustainable and versionable as the project develops. The GitHub pages well  represent OpenGulf as a concept for public interaction with the visualizations, but also access to the datasets we have published.
